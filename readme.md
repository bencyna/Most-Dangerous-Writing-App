## Description:

Writers block is a huge issue and this project makes writing a pretty intense experience. You can use this as a way to
get out of writers block and if you write something you want to keep just copy and paste all.

## Installation:

Using tkinter for the user interface, I set up the screen and styled appropriately. A timer begins and every time a key
is pressed the timer is reset to 5. If this timer gets to 1 the text goes red and if the timer gets to 0. It resets the
text to empty

## Usage:

The purpose of this project is to develop my python skills and also give an opportunity to prevent writers block
